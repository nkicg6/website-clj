* Why?
I recently had the freeing feeling that comes from wiping your hard drive and getting a fresh start. I have been using emacs and org-mode for virtually everything from programming to making documents and presentations, so when I was installing things on my newly cleaned computer, I just didn't find myself missing anything from the Microsoft Office suite. 

However, just because I'm off the microsoft train doesn't mean everyone else is... I still need to look at other people's office stuff (mostly =.docx=, and =.xlsx=), but I /really/ didn't want to install the whole suite just for that. So I used =homebrew= to download the LibreOffice suite, and despite some minor problems with rendering powerpoints, this has worked great!

* Posters with Inkscape
However, I'd like to move away from using PowerPoint or Impress to make posters, and with a retreat coming up, I need to figure out a new way to make a poster.
** Size and title
First I will try Inkscape, the free vector graphics program. I started using this [[http://bethmcmillan.com/blog/?p=1592][post]] as a guide. 

*Poster size* 

I decided I would make a 42inX36in poster. To set this up in Inkscape, open *File>Document Properties* then select Page size. I used a custom size in mm as 1066X914.

*Title* 

/More coming soon/

* Writing
I use Emacs org-mode. see my post on org-ref https://nickgeorge.net/science/org_ref_setup/

/More coming soon/
