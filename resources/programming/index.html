        <p> I am not trained in computer science, but I discovered a love for programming languages and building tools when I was pursuing my master's degree and I haven't looked back.</p> 
        <p>I am most familiar with <b>Python</b>, and that will always be my go-to scripting and data-analysis language. You really can't beat <b>R</b> for statistics or scientific graphics, so I use that a lot as well. I am learning <b>Clojure</b> and <b>ClojureScript</b>, and I am loving the new way of thinking about problems that this is allowing me. </p>

        <h1>Some tools I made/worked on</h1>
