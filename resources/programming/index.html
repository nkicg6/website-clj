<h1>Programming</h1>

<p> I am not formally trained in computer science but I discovered a love for programming languages and automation when I was pursuing my master's degree in Virginia.</p> 
<p>I am most familiar with <b>Python</b>, and that will always be my go-to scripting and data-analysis language. However, you really can't beat <b>R</b> for statistics or plotting so I use that a lot as well. I am also learning Clojure and ClojureScript, and I am loving the new way of thinking about problems that this is allowing me. </p> I will post tutorials, reminders, and general thoughts here.  
<p>One of the unifying principles of my two passions (science and programming) is building tools to help others. I think an enormous amount of time and energy is wasted in science when researchers perform menial, repetitive tasks that can and should be done by a computer. I want to make doing good science easier, so I will often post tools I am working on here as well</p>
