  <p> I study glial cells in the central nervous system called oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocytes make myelin, the fatty insulating protection around axons. Myelin and oligodendrocytes are a lot more interesting than people originally thought, and we now think that oligodendrocytes are active players in neuronal communication and may be vital for motor learning, memory, and normal behaviors.</p>
  
  <p> I am a member of the <a href="http://www.macklinlab.com/">Macklin</a> and <a href="https://www.restrepolab.org/">Restrepo labs</a> at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. I study neuron-oligodendrocyte interactions in health and disease (especially relating to olfaction and olfactory processing). Because I am part of two awesome labs, I get to combine my interests in cellular neuroscience (Macklin Lab) with systems neuroscience (Restrepo Lab) to try to understand how different cell types work together to allow us to learn and think.</p>
