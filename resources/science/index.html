<h1> Science</h1>
<p> I study glial cells in the central nervous system called oligodendrocytes. These cells make myelin, the insulating protection around axons. Although myelin was originally thought to play a passive, supportive roll, we are learning that oligodendrocytes are active players in neuronal communication and may be vital for motor learning, memory, and normal behaviors. </p>

<p> I am a member of the Macklin and Restrepo labs and study neuron-oligodendrocyte interactions in health and disease (especially relating to olfaction and olfactory processing). Here I will have notes about managing projects, cool findings, and thoughts on other science (and non-sciency) stuff as I work on my PhD. </p>
