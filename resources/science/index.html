    <div style="font-size: 18px">

        <p> I study glial cells in the central nervous system called oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocytes make myelin, the insulating protection around axons. Myelin and oligodendrocytes are a lot more interesting than people originally thought, and we now think that oligodendrocytes are active players in neuronal communication and may be vital for motor learning, memory, and normal behaviors. </p>

        <p> I am a member of the <a href="http://www.macklinlab.com/">Macklin</a> and Restrepo labs at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and I study neuron-oligodendrocyte interactions in health and disease (especially relating to olfaction and olfactory processing). Here are my notes about managing projects, cool findings, and thoughts on other science (and non-sciency) stuff as I work on my PhD. </p>

        <h1> Presentations and posters</h1>
        <p>I post all my presentations on <a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a> because I love open science and I want to show off some of the fun stuff I get to work on~!</p>
