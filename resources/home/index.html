    <b style="font-size: xx-large">I</b> am a neuroscience PhD student and I study how central nervous system myelin is influenced by (and influences) neuronal activity. I am also interested in programming languages (mostly Clojure and Python) and using those languages to build tools. 
    <p>I am <b>passionate</b> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre"><b>free</b></a> (as in speech), open-source <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">software</a> <b>AND</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">science</a>.</p>
    <p>I love learning new things using projects, and this website is how I keep track of my projects and how I did things.</p>

        <div><p><b style="font-size: xx-large">p.s. </b> </p>I use projects to learn new things and this website is no exception. I recently re-wrote it using Clojure (the original was Python-flask). I learned a lot and I am really loving Clojure. I wrote about that experience <a href="http://nickgeorge.net/programming/building-my-static-clojure-website/">here</a></div>
