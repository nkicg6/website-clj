    <b style="font-size: xx-large">I</b> am a neuroscience PhD student and I study how central nervous system myelin is influenced by (and influences) neuronal activity. I am also interested in programming languages (mostly Clojure and Python) and using those languages to build tools.

        <div><p><b style="font-size: xx-large">p.s. </b> </p>This website is one of my projects! I re-wrote it using Clojure (the original was Python-flask). I learned a lot and I am a firm believer in the Clojure/lisp philosophy. I wrote about that experience <a href="https://nickgeorge.net/programming/building-my-static-clojure-website/">here</a> and about why I am learning Clojure <a href="https://nickgeorge.net/programming/why-learn-clojure/">here</a>.</div> The website source code is also <a href="https://github.com/nkicg6/website-clj">available</a>.
