 <b style="font-size: xx-large">I</b>am a neuroscience PhD student and I study how central nervous system myelin is influenced by (and influences) neuronal activity. I am also very interested in programming languages (lisps (mostly clojure for now...) and python) and using those languages to build tools. 
<p>I am <b>passionate</b> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre"><b>free</b></a> (as in beer <i>and</i> speech), open-source <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">software</a> <b>AND</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">science</a>.</p>
<p>I love learning new things through projects, and this website is how I keep track of my projects, what I learned, and how I did things.</p>

    If you want to learn more about me, I write about things related to <p style="font-size: xx-large"><a href="/programming">Programming here</a> </p>
    and I write about things more related to  <p style="font-size: xx-large"><a href="/science">Science here</a></p>

    <div><p><b style="font-size: xx-large">p.s. </b> </p>I use projects to learn new things and this website is no exception. I recently re-wrote it using Clojure (the original was Python-flask). I learned a ton and I am really loving Clojure. I wrote about it <a href="http://nickgeorge.net/programming/building-my-static-clojure-website/">here</a>, check it out!</div>
