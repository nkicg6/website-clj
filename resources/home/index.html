    <b style="font-size: xx-large">I</b> am a neuroscience PhD student and I study how central nervous system myelin is influenced by (and influences) neuronal activity. I am also very interested in all things programming, software engineering, and data analysis.

<p>I like to learn new things, and this website is how I keep track of my projects, what I learned and how I did things. </p>

        I am currently learning Clojure, mostly because I wanted to learn functional programming and Rich Hickey gives <a href="https://github.com/tallesl/Rich-Hickey-fanclub">amazing talks</a>, but also because it is an functional programming language hosted on both the web with clojurescript (javascript) and the JVM with regular Clojure. Since clojurescript is a clojure trans-piler for javascript, that means that I can use one language to leverage all of javascript and non-web programming or backend web tasks with clojure!

        my older website was written with python and the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> framework and made into a static site with <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/">frozen-flask</a> and <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-FlatPages/">flask-flatpages</a> for hosting on github pages. I am working on making it a static site with <a href="https://github.com/magnars/stasis">Stasis</a>. I will document my progress <a href="https://github.com/nkicg6/website-clj/blob/master/doc/building-a-static-site-with-clojure.org">here</a> until I finish this site re-write, then I will put the changes on this main page. I am hoping to be done with a solid workflow within a week.
