<p><b style="font-size: x-large">This site is under construction! I am migrating to a Clojure/Stasis based static site. You can read more about it <a href="/building-a-static-site-with-clojure">here</a></b> The source code is <a href="https://github.com/nkicg6/website-clj">on github</a>.</p>
    <b style="font-size: xx-large">I</b> am a neuroscience PhD student and I study how central nervous system myelin is influenced by (and influences) neuronal activity. I am also very interested in all things programming, software engineering, and data analysis.

<p>I like to learn new things, and this website is how I keep track of my projects, what I learned and how I did things. </p>

    <h1>p.s.</h1>
    
    I am currently learning Clojure, mostly because I wanted to learn functional programming and Rich Hickey gives <a href="https://github.com/tallesl/Rich-Hickey-fanclub">amazing talks</a>, but also because it is a functional programming language hosted on both the web with Clojurescript (trans-piled to javascript) and the JVM with regular Clojure. That means that I can use one language to leverage all of Javascript for the web and I have the benefits of Java for non-web programming or backend web tasks with one well-designed functional langauge with Clojure! 
<p>
    my first static website was written with python and the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> framework and made into a static site with <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/">frozen-flask</a> and <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-FlatPages/">flask-flatpages</a> for hosting on github pages. I am now working on making it a static site with Clojure and <a href="https://github.com/magnars/stasis">Stasis</a>. <s>I will document my progress <a href="https://github.com/nkicg6/website-clj/blob/master/doc/building-a-static-site-with-clojure.org">here</a> until I finish this site re-write, then I will put the changes on this main page.</s>(see above!) I am hoping to be done with a solid workflow within a week (updated 2018-07-21).
