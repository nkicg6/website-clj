* Building blocks

Two years ago this December, I asked for, and received, a book called Clojure for the brave and true <LINK TO ME> for Christmas. I asked for this book because I have been writing semi-literate Python and R code for a few years now, happily evangelizing and using these for open science and reproducible research practices... But also because I liked doing it. I love the feeling of automating something that used to take me hours or days of manual labor and breaking it down to a script that takes a few seconds. There really is nothing better for me. 
I recently (re)built my static webstite in Clojure.
