- This is an important talk and I think needs to be heard by scientists.
- we all know there is a problem with modern science. Is it reproducible? Does it matter?
  - statistics are done improperly (we used n common to standards of the field)
  - doing flashy high risk stuff and making big claims to end up in the big journals
  - doing things wrong. Most of us /know/ that counting relative cells (cells/mm^{2} ) is (objectively) the wrong thing to do. We /know/ that we should do a pilot study with a few animals (maybe 3) then do a power analysis to measure the effect size and plan the whole study. But we /dont do it/. Why?
  - Most of us /know/ that in electrophysiology counting each cell/slice as a different sample (/n/) to be compared with a t-test or wilcox test is (objectively) /wrong/ (cells from the same animal or slice are likely (by definition) to be correlated and are not independent identically distributed samples)
    - a good citation is [[file:~/PDFs/Saravanan_Sober_2019-arx.pdf]] they have an assessment of the hierarcical data in neuroscience (citation 1 here)

  - We claim it is because the incetives are misaligned-- and they are.
  - The few jobs we have available are judged almost exclusively on "quality of science" which is a euphemism for "Do I recognize the journal?" and "is it in CNS?"
    - Once hired, tenure depends on the /same thing/ (maybe to a slightly lesser degree, tenure committees care about funding above all else).
  - The point is, if we fix the incentives will we know how to do good science?
- What is good science?
Right now, flashy people who do the minimum work to get positive results get in the top journals and get the top jobs. Then recruit the top post-docs to do real work and the cycle continues as underlings do great work and reinforce the vision of this flashy minimum work person being a genius

- 
Maybe this should be called "in defense of preregistered reports" is that how we fix science?
is science even broken?
