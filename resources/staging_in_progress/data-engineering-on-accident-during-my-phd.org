* Keeping track of patch clamp data

Whole cell patch clamp experiments can generate a lot of unstructured and heterogeneous data which can accumulate quickly. By heterogenous I mean that the data I gather comes in the form of handwritten notes in my notebook and metadata stored automatically in the proprietary axon binary format (ABF) files. 

The ABF files names are automatically generated in a standard way, and are a combination of the date and a zero padded number that is sequentially incremented for each new file. So for example a set of files from experiments performed on 2020-03-19 looks like so:


=20319000.abf, 20319001.abf,... 20319101.abf=

The files contain the experiment data including:
- different input channels from the amplifier
- time of experiment
- protocol name
and much more. 

However, each file is missing a lot of other information which I will need to do analysis, for example:
- animal id
- slice/section id
- animal treatment group
- any drugs used during the experiment
- free form notes
- whether to use the file or not

These data need to be merged for analysis, and data from several different experiments (sometimes separated by days or months) must be merged and selected for later analysis. The metadata I collect in my notebook is definitely flexible and possible to change as well.
