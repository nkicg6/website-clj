The Sqlite3 [[%0Ahttps://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Row][Row]] class allows you to return queries from your database as a case insensitive dictionary-like structure, rather than a list of unnamed tuples. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session new :results output
# make db, add items

#+END_SRC

Now using a simple query, I'll grab all the items from that database:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session new :results output
# get items

#+END_SRC

Hard to keep track of what's what. Luckily, the =Row= class can help:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session new :results output
# show row, what happens. 

#+END_SRC

I wrote this function to extract all the parts and return it as a list of dicts for some of my work:
